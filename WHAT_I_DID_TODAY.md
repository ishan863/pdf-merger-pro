## The One Blocker 🚧

**Missing:** Firebase credentials (project ID & API keys)

**Why:** You need to create Firebase project to get them

**How long:** 15 minutes total

**Steps:**
1. Create Firebase project (10 min) - at console.firebase.google.com
2. Get credentials (3 min) - from project settings
3. Create 2 files (2 min) - `.firebaserc` and `.env.local`

**After that:** Everything else is automated! ✅
