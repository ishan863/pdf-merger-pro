## 🔧 What's Ready for Firebase Integration

### Authentication (needs API keys)
```typescript
// web/.env.local (create this file)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Cloud Storage (ready to integrate)
- Upload functions in `utils/storage.ts`
- File metadata tracking in Firestore
- Resumable uploads for large files
- Signed URL generation

### Firestore (ready to integrate)
- User document structure defined
- File metadata schema ready
- CRUD operations implemented
- Real-time listeners prepared

---

## 📊 Code Quality

### TypeScript
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ All components fully typed
- ✅ No `any` types (except necessary casts)
- ✅ Type-check passes: **0 errors**

### Code Organization
- ✅ Clean folder structure
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Reusable components
- ✅ Separation of concerns

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Firebase Setup)

### 1. Add Firebase Credentials
Create `web/.env.local` with your Firebase project credentials

### 2. Test Cloud Storage
- Upload a PDF to Firebase Storage
- Verify file appears in Firestore
- Test download with signed URLs

### 3. Test Authentication
- Sign in with Google/GitHub/Facebook
- Verify user document creation
- Test logout and session persistence

### 4. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 5. Optional Enhancements
- Add unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Add analytics (Google Analytics)
- Implement rate limiting
- Add virus scanning
- Set up Sentry error monitoring

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Client-Side Only (before Firebase)
- Files stored in memory only
- No persistence across sessions
- No user authentication
- No cloud backup

### Performance Thresholds
- Client-side PDF operations work best for files < 50MB
- Very large PDFs (> 100MB) may need server-side processing
- OCR and compression will require Cloud Functions

---

## 📖 Developer Notes

### Running the App
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
