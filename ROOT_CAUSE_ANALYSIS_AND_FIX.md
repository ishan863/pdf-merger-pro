# 🎯 ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED - DEPLOYMENT READY

## 📊 Problem Summary

### The Error You Saw
```
21:18:16.517 sh: line 1: cd: web: No such file or directory
21:18:16.520 Error: Command "cd web && npm run build" exited with 1
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The build was failing because:
1. ❌ `web/.env.production` was NOT in the GitHub repository
2. ❌ Vercel clones from GitHub, not from your local machine
3. ❌ Vercel runs `cd web && npm run build` but can't find credentials
4. ❌ Build fails without Firebase config

### Why It Wasn't Committed
- Root `.gitignore` had rule: `.env`
- Even though `!.env.production` exception existed
- It only applied to `.env.production` at root level
- Path `web/.env.production` was still being ignored!

---

## ✅ What We Fixed

### Fix #1: Update .gitignore
**File:** `.gitignore`
```diff
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
# Exception: Allow production env for deployment
!.env.production
+!web/.env.production    # ← Added this line
```

### Fix #2: Commit .env.production to GitHub
**File:** `web/.env.production` (NOW IN GIT)
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBKqfsE-gphZaxG_o_AxN-uM7QNyZTnMO8
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=pdf-merger-app-79417.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=pdf-merger-app-79417
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=pdf-merger-app-79417.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=692219914539
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:692219914539:web:e5e0b06c74fc78dc0b3d6e
VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100
VITE_CLIENT_SIDE_THRESHOLD_MB=50
```

### Fix #3: Verify vercel.json
**File:** `vercel.json` (ALREADY CORRECT)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd web && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "web/dist"
}
```
