## What You Asked For:
> "For split pdf add all features in merge section use a logic page remover for all like i want to remove page 4 or multiple page from the different pdf according to that add more smart features for all merge and the split pdf"

---

## What You Got: ✅

### 1. **Page Remover Component** 
A smart tool to remove specific pages from any PDF. Used for:
- Removing pages from PDFs before merging
- Removing pages from PDFs before splitting
- Future: Removing pages before converting

**How it works:**
```
1. See thumbnail preview of all pages
2. Click pages you want to REMOVE (marked in red)
3. Click "Remove X pages" button
4. Pages are deleted from that PDF
5. Automatically updates merge/split operations
```

---

### 2. **Smart Merge with Page Removal**
**New Workflow:**
```
Upload PDFs
  ↓
For each PDF:
  - See all pages as thumbnails
  - Click pages to mark for deletion
  - Confirm removal
  ↓
Unwanted pages disappear from all PDFs
  ↓
Reorder remaining pages as usual
  ↓
Merge clean PDFs
  ↓
Download merged file
```

**Example Use Case:**
- You have 3 PDFs with some blank/blank pages
- Instead of downloading merged.pdf with blanks
- You remove the blanks FIRST using page remover
- Then merge only the good pages
- Result: Clean merged PDF with no blanks!

---

### 3. **Smart Split with 4 Modes**

#### Mode 1: Manual Select (Your Original Feature)
- Click pages to select which ones to keep
- Download selected pages

#### Mode 2: Split by Size ⭐
- **5MB chunks**: Creates multiple PDFs of max 5MB each
- **10MB chunks**: Creates multiple PDFs of max 10MB each
- **20MB chunks**: Creates multiple PDFs of max 20MB each
- Perfect for large files that can't be emailed

#### Mode 3: Split Even/Odd ⭐
- **Odd pages**: Separate pages 1, 3, 5, 7...
- **Even pages**: Separate pages 2, 4, 6, 8...
- Useful for scanned documents with orientation issues

#### Mode 4: Auto-Split Every N Pages ⭐
- Split every 5 pages
- Split every 10 pages
- Split every 50 pages
- Split every X pages (custom)
- Automatically creates multiple PDFs

**Example Use Cases:**

```
Case 1: Email Too Large
Problem: 150MB PDF won't fit in email (limit 25MB)
Solution: Split by 5MB → 30 small PDFs that can be emailed

Case 2: Scanned Document Upside Down
Problem: Half the pages are upside down after scanning
Solution: Split even/odd → Separate good pages from bad
Then: Rotate bad pages → Merge back together

Case 3: Long Book into Chapters
Problem: 500-page book is hard to read on phone
Solution: Auto-split every 50 pages → 10 chapter PDFs
Result: Much easier to read on mobile
```
