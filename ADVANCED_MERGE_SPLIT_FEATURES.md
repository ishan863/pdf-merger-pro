## 🎯 Use Cases

### Merge + Page Removal
**Scenario:** You have 3 PDFs:
- Document1.pdf (20 pages, but pages 5-8 are blank)
- Document2.pdf (15 pages, all good)
- Document3.pdf (10 pages, but page 3 is blank)

**Old Way:** Download merged.pdf with 43 pages total (including 3 blank pages)

**New Way:** 
1. Upload all 3 PDFs
2. From Document1: Remove pages 5-8 (4 pages removed)
3. From Document3: Remove page 3 (1 page removed)
4. Merge: Now merged.pdf has only 38 pages (no blanks!)
5. Reorder pages if needed
6. Download clean, optimized PDF

---

### Split + Smart Modes
**Scenario 1 - Large PDF too big for email:**
- Old PDF: 150 MB (can't send via email)
- Solution: Split by 5MB → Creates 30 PDFs (each ~5MB)
- Now you can send them via email or cloud storage

**Scenario 2 - Scanned document with duplex issue:**
- Scanned PDF: 100 pages (odd pages are upside down)
- Solution: Split Even/Odd
- Odd pages (1,3,5...): All upside down
- Even pages (2,4,6...): All correct
- Fix odd pages with rotate, then merge back together

**Scenario 3 - Long document needs breaking up:**
- Book PDF: 500 pages
- Solution: Auto-split every 50 pages
- Creates 10 PDFs: Chapter_1.pdf (pages 1-50), Chapter_2.pdf (pages 51-100), etc.
- Perfect for reading on phone or sharing specific chapters
