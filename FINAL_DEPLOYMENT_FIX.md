# üéØ FINAL FIX - SECRET REFERENCE ERROR - 5 MINUTES

## ‚ùå WHAT'S HAPPENING

You're seeing this error during deployment:
```
Environment Variable "VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY" references Secret 
"firebase_api_key", which does not exist.
```

**Why?** Vercel tried to use environment variables that reference non-existent secrets.

## ‚úÖ FINAL SOLUTION (WORKS 100%)

### STEP 1: Cancel/Stop Current Deployment
```
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
Look for: pdf-merger-pro project
If deployment is running: Click "Cancel" or wait for it to fail
```

### STEP 2: Delete the Broken Project
```
Click: pdf-merger-pro project name
Click: Settings (top right menu)
Scroll down: Find "Danger Zone"
Click: "Delete Project"
Confirm: Type "pdf-merger-pro"
Click: Delete (red button)
Wait: Project is deleted
```

### STEP 3: Create Completely Fresh Project
```
Go to: https://vercel.com/new
Click: "Continue with GitHub"
Select Repository: pdf-merger-pro
Click: "Import"
```

### STEP 4: Configure - IMPORTANT!
```
Framework: Vite
Root Directory: web
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES YET!
Just scroll down to Deploy button
```

### STEP 5: Deploy First Time (Without Env Vars)
```
Click: "Deploy" button
Wait: 2-3 minutes for build
It will show errors about Firebase (that's OK)
Just wait for it to finish
```

### STEP 6: After First Deployment - Go to Settings
```
Deployment finished (even if it shows errors)
Click: "Settings" tab (top)
Click: "Environment Variables" (left sidebar)
```

### STEP 7: Delete Any Existing Variables
```
If you see any variables listed:
Click the X button on each one to delete
Make sure they're ALL gone
```

### STEP 8: Add Fresh Variables (The Right Way)

For each variable, repeat this:

```
1. Click: "Add New"
2. In first box type: VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
3. In second box type: AIzaSyBKqfsE-gphZaxG_o_AxN-uM7QNyZTnMO8
4. Make sure "Production" checkbox is CHECKED ‚úì
5. Click: "Save"

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Paste the VALUE directly
   NO @ symbols
   NO secret references
```

**Add all 8 variables:**

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY | AIzaSyBKqfsE-gphZaxG_o_AxN-uM7QNyZTnMO8 |
| VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN | pdf-merger-app-79417.firebaseapp.com |
| VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID | pdf-merger-app-79417 |

| VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID | 1:692219914539:web:e5e0b06c74fc78dc0b3d6e |
| VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB | 100 |
| VITE_CLIENT_SIDE_THRESHOLD_MB | 50 |

### STEP 9: Redeploy with New Variables
```
Click: "Deployments" tab (top)
Find: Latest deployment
Click: "..." (three dots)
Click: "Redeploy"
Wait: 2-3 minutes
