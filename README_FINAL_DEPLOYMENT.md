Vercel is showing:
"Environment Variable references Secret which does not exist"

This is because wrong env format was used
```

### The Solution
```
1. Delete the broken project
2. Create a fresh one
3. Deploy without env vars first
4. Add proper env vars after deployment
5. Redeploy with new variables
6. Your app goes LIVE!
```
