# Setup & Testing Summary 📋

## What I Found 🔍

Your workspace has everything ready **EXCEPT** Firebase credentials. Here's what I discovered:

### ✅ Ready
- Firebase CLI installed: v14.19.1
- Node.js: v22.17.0
- npm: v10.9.2
- `firebase.json` configured
- All source code files complete (2,500+ lines)

### ❌ Missing
- `.firebaserc` file (not created)
- `.env.local` file (no credentials)
- Firebase project (not created yet)
- Firestore database (not initialized)

---

## What You Need to Do 🎯

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project & Get Credentials (15 minutes)
**File:** `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md` (created for you)

Follow the 7 steps:
1. Create Firebase project: console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Firestore, Storage, Auth, Functions
3. Get Firebase config
4. Create `.firebaserc` with project ID
5. Create `.env.local` with credentials
6. Run `firebase projects:list` to verify
7. Ready to deploy!

---

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure (5 minutes)
Once credentials are set, run:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\setup-firestore.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup-firestore.sh
```

This deploys:
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ✅ Cloud Storage rules
- ✅ Cloud Functions
- ✅ Initializes 6 collections

---

### Step 3: Verify Setup (5 minutes)
Check in Firebase Console:
- [ ] Firestore Database exists
- [ ] 6 Collections created:
  - users
  - files
  - conversions
  - collab_sessions
  - audit_logs
  - settings
- [ ] Storage bucket visible
- [ ] Cloud Functions deployed
- [ ] Security rules active

---

### Step 4: Test Features (30-60 minutes)
**File:** `FEATURE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (created for you)

Tests 14 major features:
1. **Authentication** - Sign up, login, password reset
2. **File Upload** - PDF, images, CSV auto-conversion
3. **PDF Viewing** - Page navigation, zoom, thumbnails
4. **Page Editing** - Rotate, delete, duplicate, reorder
