# 🎯 What You Need to Know (Simplified)

## The Bottom Line

Your PDF app is **COMPLETE and READY**. 

One thing is missing: **Firebase credentials** (takes 15 minutes to set up).

---

## What Works NOW ✅

You can use these features without Firebase:
- Upload files
- View PDFs
- Edit pages (rotate, delete, reorder)
- Draw annotations
- Merge & split PDFs
- Convert images to PDF

---

## What NEEDS Firebase ❌

These features need Firebase setup:
- User accounts
- Save files to cloud
- Convert Word/Excel/PowerPoint to PDF
- Real-time collaboration with others
- Extract text with OCR

---

## What You Need to Do 🎯

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (10 min)
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add Project"
3. Name it "pdf-merger"
4. Enable: Firestore, Storage, Auth, Functions
5. Done!

### Step 2: Get Credentials (5 min)
1. In Firebase → Project Settings
2. Scroll to "Your Apps"
3. Click the web app (or create one)
4. Copy the config (big JSON block)

### Step 3: Add to Your Project (2 min)
Create 2 files in your project folder:

**File 1: `.firebaserc`**
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
  }
}
```

**File 2: `.env.local`**
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

### Step 4: Deploy (5 min)
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:
```
.\scripts\setup-firestore.bat
```

Wait for ✅ "Deployment Complete" message.

### Step 5: Verify (5 min)

2. Check Firestore > Data
3. Should see 6 collections:
