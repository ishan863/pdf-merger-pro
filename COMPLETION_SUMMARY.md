## 🎯 What's Ready to Do

### Next 5 Concrete Tasks (Priority Order)

#### 1. Extend UploadZone (1-2 days)
**What:** Accept images, text, CSV, office documents  
**File:** `web/src/components/UploadZone.tsx`  
**Change:** accept filter + conversion detection + consent modal flow  
**Code Pattern:** Already prepared in `conversion.ts`

#### 2. Create PageEditorModal (2-3 days)
**What:** Full-screen page grid editor with multi-select  
**File:** `web/src/components/PageEditorModal.tsx` (NEW)  
**Features:** Thumbnail grid + multi-select + action buttons  
**Integration:** Connect to `useEditorStore`

#### 3. Implement Thumbnail Worker (2-3 days)
**What:** Lazy-load thumbnails using OffscreenCanvas  
**File:** `web/src/workers/thumbnailWorker.ts` (NEW)  
**Benefits:** 10-50x faster (100 pages in <200ms vs 2-3sec)  
**Integration:** Use with Intersection Observer

#### 4. Test End-to-End (1 day)
**What:** Upload image → Convert → Edit → Merge  
**Coverage:** Images, text, CSV, office docs (when ready)  
**Keyboard:** Shortcuts (Ctrl+K search, etc.)

#### 5. Cloud Function for Server Conversions (1-2 days)
**What:** Office document conversion (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)  
**File:** `functions/src/convertFile.ts` (NEW)  
**Tech:** LibreOffice CLI backend  
**Flow:** User consents → Convert → Store → Clean up

**Total Phase 1 Time:** 2-3 weeks
